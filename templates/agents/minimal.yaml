# CrewX Custom Agents Configuration
# 
# This file is for your project-specific custom agents.
# Built-in agents (@claude, @gemini, @copilot, @crewx) are always available
# and don't need to be defined here.
#
# Add your custom agents below:

agents: []
  # Example custom agent:
  # - id: "my_agent"
  #   name: "My Custom Agent"
  #   role: "developer"
  #   team: "My Team"
  #   working_directory: "./"
  #   options:
  #     query:
  #       - "--add-dir=."
  #   inline:
  #     type: "agent"
  #     provider: "claude"
  #     model: "sonnet"  # Optional: specify model
  #     system_prompt: |
  #       Your custom system prompt here...
