# CrewX Code of Conduct

We are committed to creating a welcoming, collaborative community for everyone building with CrewX. This Code of Conduct outlines the expectations we have for maintainers, contributors, and community members.

## Our Standards

**Positive behaviours include:**
- Showing empathy and respect for different backgrounds, viewpoints, and experiences
- Offering constructive feedback with clear technical rationale
- Accepting responsibility and apologising when mistakes occur
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project

**Unacceptable behaviours include:**
- Harassment, discrimination, or derogatory comments
- Trolling, personal or political attacks, or sustained disruption of discussions
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Scope
This Code applies to all project spaces—GitHub repositories, issue trackers, pull requests, documentation, community channels, and private correspondence initiated in the context of CrewX.

## Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of behaviour and will take appropriate corrective action in response to any unacceptable behaviour. Maintainers have the right and responsibility to edit, remove, or reject contributions that violate this Code, and may temporarily or permanently ban contributors for behaviours they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Enforcement
- Report incidents via email to `conduct@sowonlabs.com` (or privately to any maintainer).
- All complaints will be reviewed promptly and kept confidential to the extent possible.
- Maintainers will communicate decisions, boundaries, or required corrective actions.
- Repeated or severe violations may result in a temporary or permanent ban from project spaces.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) version 2.1.

By participating in CrewX, you agree to uphold this Code of Conduct and help create a respectful, inclusive community.
