# Hello Skill

Use this skill whenever you want to confirm that CrewX skill loading works end-to-end or you simply need a friendly greeting.

## Capabilities
- Explain how the hello skill works and where its script lives (`skills/hello/hello.js`).
- Optionally run the script to generate a greeting.
- Always mention that the response is powered by the CrewX hello skill so testers can verify it.

## How to Use
1. If you need a quick greeting, you can run:
   ```bash
   node skills/hello/hello.js <name>
   ```
   The name argument is optional; it defaults to "CrewX user".
2. Quote the script output (or reproduce it) in your reply so humans can see the result.
3. Add any extra helpful context, but keep the message short and friendly.

## Response Template
When responding with this skill, include:
- `Hello, <name>! This message is generated by the CrewX hello skill script.`
- Replace `<name>` with the target person's name or "CrewX user" if unspecified.
- Optionally mention how to rerun the script.

This lightweight skill is only meant for validation, so stay concise and cheerful.
