## Project Overview

CrewX is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that enables multi-AI agent collaboration for development tasks. The project integrates multiple AI providers (Claude CLI, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI) through a unified interface for team-based coding assistance.


## Important - AI Agent Collaboration Strategy

### When to Use CrewX MCP Agents:

**üöÄ ALWAYS use MCP agents for these scenarios:**
1. **Multi-step implementation tasks** - Break down into agent-specific subtasks
2. **Code analysis from different perspectives** - Use parallel agents for comprehensive review
3. **Architecture decisions** - Get input from multiple specialized agents
4. **Complex debugging** - Leverage different AI strengths for root cause analysis
5. **Documentation and testing** - Delegate to appropriate agents based on expertise

**ü§ñ Agent Selection Strategy:**
- Use `@claude` for: Complex reasoning, detailed analysis, architectural decisions
- Use `@gemini` for: Performance optimization, mathematical problems, data analysis  
- Use `@copilot` for: Code implementation, testing, best practices

**‚ö° Execution Patterns:**
```
# Single complex task - break it down
Instead of: "Implement user authentication system"
Use: executeAgentParallel with:
- @claude: "Design authentication architecture and security model" 
- @copilot: "Implement JWT token handling and middleware"
- @gemini: "Create performance-optimized session management"

# Multi-perspective analysis
Instead of: "Review this code"
Use: queryAgentParallel with:
- @claude: "Analyze code architecture and design patterns"
- @copilot: "Review for bugs, edge cases, and best practices" 
- @gemini: "Evaluate performance and optimization opportunities"
```

**üéØ MCP Tool Usage Guidelines:**
- Use MCP tool agents for complex tasks.
- Use `listAgents` to check available agents before delegation
- Prefer `queryAgentParallel` and `executeAgentParallel` for efficiency
- Always provide specific, actionable tasks to each agent
- Include project context and working directory information

## Architecture Guidelines

### Core Components
- **NestJS Framework**: Use NestJS patterns and decorators for all new features
- **Service Layer Architecture**: Separated into specialized services for maintainability
  - `ParallelProcessingService`: Handles multi-agent parallel execution
  - `TaskManagementService`: Manages task lifecycle and logging with unique taskIds
  - `ResultFormatterService`: Unified output formatting for CLI and MCP
- **AI Provider Interface**: Extend `BaseAiProvider` for new AI integrations
- **Agent System**: Configure agents through `agents.yaml` with dynamic CLI options
- **TypeScript**: Maintain strict typing throughout the codebase

### File Structure
- `src/providers/`: AI provider implementations
- `src/services/`: Core business logic services
  - `parallel-processing.service.ts`: Multi-agent execution coordination
  - `task-management.service.ts`: Task tracking and logging
  - `result-formatter.service.ts`: Output formatting for different interfaces
- `src/cli/`: CLI interface handlers
  - `cli.handler.ts`: Main CLI routing and NestJS context management
  - `query.handler.ts`: Natural language query parsing and agent mention handling
  - `execute.handler.ts`: Task execution interface
- `src/utils/`: Utility functions (config, error handling, string manipulation)
- `agents.yaml`: Agent configuration with CLI options
- `tests/`: Unit and integration tests

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript Conventions
- Use strict type definitions for all functions and classes
- Prefer interfaces over type aliases for object shapes
- Use enum values for constants and configuration options
- Implement proper error handling with custom error types

### Code Quality
- Write comprehensive JSDoc comments for all public methods
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Maintain single responsibility principle for classes and functions
- Implement proper logging using the stderr logger service

### Testing Requirements
- Write unit tests for all new features in the `tests/` directory
- Use Vitest as the testing framework
- Mock external dependencies (AI providers, file system operations)
- Maintain test coverage for critical functionality

## AI Provider Integration

### Adding New AI Providers
- Extend the `BaseAiProvider` abstract class
- Implement the `IAiProvider` interface
- Add provider configuration to the providers module
- Update the AI service to include the new provider

### CLI Integration Pattern
```typescript
// Use this pattern for CLI command execution
const result = await this.executeCommand(command, options);
if (!result.success) {
  throw new Error(`Provider failed: ${result.error}`);
}
```

## Agent Configuration

### agents.yaml Structure
- Each agent must have: `name`, `role`, `provider`, `description`
- Use the `options[]` array for dynamic CLI configuration
- **Security Warning**: Be cautious with dangerous options like `--force`, `--delete`, `--overwrite`
- Provide clear descriptions for all agent capabilities

### Safe CLI Options Examples
```yaml
options:
  - "--verbose"           # Safe: Increases output detail
  - "--dry-run"          # Safe: Shows what would happen without executing
  - "--help"             # Safe: Shows help information
  
# Avoid these dangerous options without explicit user confirmation:
# - "--force"            # Dangerous: Bypasses safety checks
# - "--delete"           # Dangerous: Removes files/resources
# - "--overwrite"        # Dangerous: Replaces existing files
```

## Development Workflow

### Before Implementing Features
1. Review existing service implementations in `src/services/` for patterns
2. Check if similar functionality exists in utils/ or existing services
3. Consider configuration options in agents.yaml
4. Plan error handling and logging strategy with TaskManagementService
5. Understand CLI vs MCP interface requirements

### Code Implementation
- Follow NestJS dependency injection patterns
- Use specialized services (ParallelProcessingService, TaskManagementService, ResultFormatterService)
- Use the project's error utilities for consistent error handling
- Implement proper input validation
- Add appropriate logging statements with task tracking
- Ensure taskId propagation through the entire execution chain

### Service Integration Patterns
```typescript
// Inject required services
constructor(
  private readonly parallelProcessingService: ParallelProcessingService,
  private readonly taskManagementService: TaskManagementService,
  private readonly resultFormatterService: ResultFormatterService,
) {}

// Create and track tasks
const taskId = this.taskManagementService.createTask({
  type: 'query',
  provider: agentProvider,
  prompt: userQuery,
  agentId: agentId
});

// Use parallel processing for multiple agents
const result = await this.parallelProcessingService.queryAgentsParallel(queries, options);

// Format results consistently
const formatted = this.resultFormatterService.formatParallelResult(results, summary, readOnly);
```

### Testing Strategy
- Write tests before implementing complex logic
- Test both success and failure scenarios for services
- Mock external dependencies appropriately
- Verify configuration parsing and validation
- Test taskId propagation and logging
- Validate CLI and MCP interface compatibility

## MCP Server Specifics

### Tool Implementation
- Follow MCP protocol standards for tool definitions
- Provide clear tool descriptions and parameter schemas
- Implement proper error responses for invalid requests
- Use structured logging for debugging MCP interactions
- Ensure taskId is included in all responses for traceability

### Agent Execution
- Validate agent configurations before execution
- Sanitize CLI options to prevent security issues
- Provide clear feedback on execution status with taskId
- Handle timeouts and resource limits appropriately
- Use ParallelProcessingService for multi-agent coordination
- Ensure proper success/failure status propagation

### CLI Interface
- CLI acts as a client to CrewXTool, sharing the same NestJS services
- Parse natural language @mentions into structured agent queries
- Automatically route to single or parallel execution based on agent count
- Use identical business logic as MCP tools for consistency
- Format output appropriately for terminal display

### Task Management
- Every operation gets a unique taskId for tracking
- Log all significant events with TaskManagementService
- Provide task logs for debugging and audit trails
- Ensure taskId visibility in both CLI and MCP interfaces

## Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation
- Document all public APIs with JSDoc
- Include parameter types and return value descriptions
- Provide usage examples for complex functions
- Document configuration options and their effects

### README Updates
- Keep installation instructions current
- Document new agent types and capabilities
- Update troubleshooting sections for common issues
- Maintain accurate CLI examples

## Security Considerations

### CLI Option Safety
- Validate all CLI options against allowlists
- Warn users about potentially dangerous operations
- Implement confirmation prompts for destructive actions
- Log security-relevant operations for audit trails

### Input Validation
- Sanitize all user inputs before processing
- Validate file paths to prevent directory traversal
- Check permissions before file operations
- Implement rate limiting for resource-intensive operations

## Common Patterns

### Error Handling
```typescript
try {
  const result = await dangerousOperation();
  return { success: true, data: result };
} catch (error) {
  this.logger.error('Operation failed', error);
  return { success: false, error: error.message };
}
```

### Configuration Loading
```typescript
const config = this.configService.loadAgentConfig(agentId);
if (!config) {
  throw new Error(`Agent configuration not found: ${agentId}`);
}
```

### CLI Command Building
```typescript
const command = this.buildCommand(baseCommand, sanitizedOptions);
const result = await this.executeWithTimeout(command, timeoutMs);
```
