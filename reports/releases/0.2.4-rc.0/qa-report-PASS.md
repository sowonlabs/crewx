### Detailed Test Results

#### 1. Environment Variable Support (NEW Feature - Commit 76df4f6)
**Status:** ✅ **PASS**

Tested scenarios:
- ✅ Basic env var passing to CLI process (4 variables: TEST_ENV, MOCK_API_URL, MOCK_TOKEN, CUSTOM_VAR)
- ✅ Backward compatibility (providers work without env vars)
- ✅ Real-world configuration examples (Remote Ollama, Aider integration)

**Evidence:**
```yaml
providers:
  - id: mock_env
    type: plugin
    cli_command: test-tools/mock-cli
    env:
      TEST_ENV: "development"
      MOCK_API_URL: "http://localhost:8080"
      MOCK_TOKEN: "test-token-123"
      CUSTOM_VAR: "custom-value"
```

All environment variables correctly passed to CLI process. No security issues detected (dangerous vars blocked per security validation).

#### 2. Core CLI Regression Tests
**Status:** ✅ **PASS**

- ✅ Basic query: `crewx query "@claude:haiku hello"` → Working
- ✅ Basic execute: `crewx execute "@claude:haiku echo test"` → Working
- ✅ Agent listing: All 4 built-in agents listed correctly
- ✅ Custom config loading: `--config` option working with crewx.mock.yaml

**No regressions detected** in core functionality.

#### 3. Codex Provider Basic Check (Commit b316dc4)
**Status:** ✅ **PASS**

- ✅ Codex CLI 0.42.0 available on system
- ✅ Plugin provider system supports Codex integration
- ✅ Infrastructure ready for optional user integration

**Note:** Codex agent not configured by default (expected - optional feature).

#### 4. Build and Deployment
**Status:** ✅ **PASS**

- ✅ Build process: `npm run build` successful
- ✅ Version: 0.2.4-dev.6 ready for RC tagging
- ✅ Shebang and permissions set correctly
