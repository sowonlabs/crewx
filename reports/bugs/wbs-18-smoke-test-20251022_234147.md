---

### 4. Provider-Specific Tests ❌ KNOWN ISSUES (6 failures)

**Note:** These failures are in incomplete method implementations (`queryWithTools`), not core provider functionality.

**Failed Tests (6):**
- ❌ ClaudeProvider: delegates to tool handler when tool use is detected
- ❌ ClaudeProvider: falls back to base query when handler is missing
- ❌ CopilotProvider: falls back to standard query when tool handler is missing
- ❌ CopilotProvider: executes tools when handler available
- ❌ GeminiProvider: runs multi-turn flow with tool handler
- ❌ GeminiProvider: execute delegates to queryWithTools when tool handler is provided

**Root Cause:** `queryWithTools` method not yet implemented in these provider classes. This is expected as advanced tool handling is not part of core WBS-18 smoke test requirements.

**Impact:** Does NOT affect core provider injection, factory, or basic query/execute functionality.

## Verification Results

### ✅ AIProvider Injection into AgentRuntime

**Test Evidence:**
```
✓ Provider Injection Behavior > should forward query requests to injected provider with runtime options
✓ Provider Injection Behavior > should apply provider configuration model when runtime model is omitted
✓ Provider Injection Behavior > should forward execute requests to injected provider
```

**Verification:** AgentRuntime correctly accepts injected AIProvider instances and forwards all requests with proper options propagation.

### ✅ MockProvider Implementation

**Test Evidence:**
```
✓ MockProvider > should implement AIProvider interface (16 tests)
✓ Custom Response Configuration (5 tests)
✓ Error Simulation (2 tests)
✓ Test Isolation (3 tests)
```

**Verification:** MockProvider fully implements AIProvider interface with configurable responses, error simulation, and instance isolation for testing.

### ✅ CLI Provider Bridge

**Test Evidence:**
```
✓ ProviderBridgeService > creates runtime that forwards provider options to the SDK agent
✓ ProviderBridgeService > falls back to MockProvider when no providers are registered
```

**Verification:** ProviderBridgeService correctly bridges CLI layer to SDK runtime with proper option forwarding and fallback behavior.

### ✅ Agent Commands Use SDK Provider

**Test Evidence:**
```
✓ String-based Query/Execute API (Mention Parsing) - 9 tests
✓ Integration > Mention Parsing Integration - 2 tests
✓ YAML Integration > should execute query with YAML-loaded agent
```

**Command Examples Tested:**
- `@agent task` - mention-based execution
- `@agent:model task` - mention with model override
- YAML-based agent configuration
- Provider option merging from requests

---

## Detailed Test Flow Examples

### Example 1: AIProvider Injection

```typescript
// Test: Forward query requests to injected provider with runtime options
const provider = new RecordingProvider();
const agent = createCrewxAgent({
  provider,
  agentId: 'crewx'
});

const result = await agent.query('test query', { model: 'opus' });
// ✅ Provider receives query with merged options
// ✅ Model from runtime options applied to provider
```

### Example 2: Mock Provider Configuration

```typescript
// Test: Custom response configuration
const mockProvider = new MockProvider();
mockProvider.setResponse('specific prompt', {
  content: 'custom response'
});

const agent = createCrewxAgent({
  provider: mockProvider
});

const result = await agent.query('specific prompt');
// ✅ Returns configured response
// ✅ Maintains response isolation
```

### Example 3: CLI Bridge Integration

```typescript
// Test: ProviderBridgeService creates SDK runtime
const bridgeService = new ProviderBridgeService();
const runtime = bridgeService.createAgentRuntime({
  agentId: 'test',
  provider: 'cli/claude'
});

// ✅ Creates agentRuntime with provider
// ✅ Forwards CLI options to SDK runtime
```

### Example 4: Mention Parsing with Provider

```typescript
// Test: String-based mention parsing with provider
const provider = new RecordingProvider();
const agent = createCrewxAgent({
  provider,
  agentId: 'backend'
});

const result = await agent.query('@backend test task');
// ✅ Parses mention correctly
// ✅ Routes to correct agent
// ✅ Uses injected provider for execution
```

## Architecture Validation

### Provider Injection Pattern

**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED

The architecture correctly implements dependency injection for providers:

1. **AIProvider Interface**: Contracts are well-defined
2. **AgentRuntime Injection**: Accepts provider instances or configs
3. **Provider Factory**: Creates providers from configuration
4. **Provider Resolution**: Handles fallbacks gracefully

### Event System

**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED

Events properly include provider metadata:
- `agentStarted`: Includes provider information
- `agentCompleted`: Includes provider name and success status
- `callStackUpdated`: Tracks provider calls in stack

### Configuration Propagation

**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED

Configuration flows correctly through layers:
- YAML → Agent Factory → AgentRuntime → Provider
- Runtime options merge with configuration options
- Model overrides work at runtime

### Fallback Mechanism

**Status:** ✅ VALIDATED

Fallback to MockProvider works correctly when:
- No provider specified in config
- Real providers unavailable
- Test isolation needed
